My current research develops along the intersection between epidemiology and climate sciences to understand how different climate factors and other related environmental stressors affect health in the context of climate change. In particular, my research interests concern the evaluation of adaptation strategies, mitigation policies and air pollution co-benefits. My research also focuses on the development of new methodologies in projections of climate change impacts, health effects of compound events and detection and attribution studies. I have led and collaborated in several large epidemiological studies on temperature-related health impacts (e.g. within the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network) and nationwide studies in US, Switzerland and UK. She is also a contributing authors of the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).    
I hold an MSc in Environmental Toxicology (University of Valencia, Spain) and Epidemiology (University of Turin). After the completion of my PhD studies (University of Valencia) in 2014, I joined different research institutions in Sweden (Umea University), Switzerland (Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute) and the UK (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine).    
I am currently an early-career researcher at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Bern (Switzerland), a member of the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research of the University of Bern and an Honorary Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
