I am an environmental epidemiologist with interests in climate change research, planetary health and development of advanced epidemiological methods.

Since September 2019, I lead the Climate Change and Health research group - EpiCimLab at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Bern. I am also a member of the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research (University of Bern). I hold an MSc in Environmental Toxicology (University of Valencia, Spain) and Epidemiology (University of Turin, Italy). Since the completion of my PhD studies (University of Valencia) in 2014, I joined different research institutions as early career researcher in Sweden (Umea University), Switzerland (Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute) and the UK (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine).

My research develops along the intersection between epidemiology and climate sciences to understand how different climate factors and other related environmental stressors affect human health in the context of climate change and planetary health. In particular, I am interested in assessing vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive diseases across populations and exploring mechanisms linking exposures and impacts.

My research interests also concern the design and evaluation of adaptation strategies, mitigation policies and air pollution co-benefits at local, regional, and global scales.

Finally, my research also focuses on the development of new methodologies in climate epidemiology, including advanced heath impact projection frameworks, health effects of compound events and detection and attribution studies.

Since 2017 I am a member of the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. I actively contribute to the network by leading and collaborating in several large epidemiological studies on health impacts associated to non-optimal temperatures and air pollution. Additionally, I am also leading and participating in nationwide and local studies in Switzerland, Spain, Japan, Brazil, Canada and the UK. I have participated in several national and international projects funded by renown agencies such as Medical Research Council in the UK and EU (H2020).

I teach several undergraduate and postgraduate courses at the University of Bern, as well as I supervise MD and MSc Thesis of students. Among the different teaching activities, I set up a new course on "Epidemiology applied to climate sciences" in the MSc of Climate Sciences of the University of Bern. Together with my former LSHTM colleagues, I give several specialized courses on time series methods - for example, at the European Educational Programme in Epidemiology.

I am a contributing author of the Working Group 2 (Chapter 16) of the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). I am currently a member of the European Chapter of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (link) and the Health and Environment committee of the European Respiratory Society. I am also a member of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics commission of the Swiss Academy of Science.
