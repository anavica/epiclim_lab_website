I am in my 2nd year of the master’s program in Climate Sciences at the University of Bern. My research interests focus on the analysis of the impact of climate change on health and providing a scientific basis for the policy-making process. I am working on my MSc Thesis entitled “The association of extreme precipitation events and mental health hospitalizations in Switzerland" at the EpiClimLab - Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine supervised by Dr. Ana M. Vicedo-Cabrera and Prof. Dr. Olivia Romppainen-Martius.

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Earth Science Education with a minor in General Science from the Ewha Womans University (South Korea) in 2019. Before starting my MSc at the University of Bern, I did an internship at the World Meteorological Organization and worked at the Korea Meteorological Institute as an assistant researcher in collaboration with several NGOs, international organizations, and governmental agencies.
