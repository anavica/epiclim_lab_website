I grew up in Bern where I attended the High School Lerbermatt, to which I attribute my fascination for the natural science. I earned a Bachelor of Earth System Science at the University of Zurich with a focus on land surfaces in 2020. My Bachelorâ€˜s thesis focused on GIS for disaster management, namely how GIS can be used to understand, manage, and mitigate wildfires. In 2020, I moved back to Bern to start the MSc in Climate Science at the University of Bern. 
Currently, I am working on my MSc Thesis in the Climate Change and Health Group - EpiClimLab at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine of the University of Bern. Mt study is about trends in tropical nights and their impact on mortality in Switzerland. I am  interested in how the different spheres interact with each other and how the Climate Change influence this whole system. I am fascinated by linking this knowledge in an interdisciplinary way and collaborating with people from different fields. Through this way I discovered my interest in epidemiology and how climate affects our health in general.
