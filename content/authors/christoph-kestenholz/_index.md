I am MSc at the Graduate School of Climate Sciences at the University of Bern (Switzerland). I am currently working on my MSc thesis in the EpiClimLab under the supervision of Ana M. Vicedo-Cabrera and Jakob Zscheischler (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ, Leipzig, Germany). I investigate the effect of heat stress and compound events on human health. In particular, the role of humidity associated with high temperatures on adverse health outcomes lies at the heart of my research interest.
I hold a BSc in Physics from Universit√© Paul Sabatier III, Toulouse (France). I studied in Pavia and Vienna, where I wrote my BSc thesis on uncertainty relations for qubit observables at the Atominstitut of TU Wien (Austria).
