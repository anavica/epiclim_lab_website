I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group Environmental Physics Laboratory (EPhysLab) at the University of Vigo (Spain). I am collaborating with the EpiClimLab on a multi-country study on the impact of heat on preterm births (part of the Multi-Country Multi-City collaborative research network).     
My main research interests are (1) the impact of extreme climate events and environmental hazards on on health, including the effects of compound events on health, (2) the roleof social determinants on the impact of climatic and environmental factors on health, especially in vulnerable groups (e.g. elderly, pregnant women, children).    
I hold a PhD from the University of Vigo (Spain) (Feb. 2018- Oct.2020). My doctoral thesis was about the effect of drought on daily mortality in the Iberian Peninsula, with international mention and qualified with Cum Laude. I received a predoctoral scholarship of the Gallegan Govern[complete]. During my PhD studies, I also worked at the National School of Public Health at the Carlos III National Institute of Health in Madrid (Spain). One of the five articles that constitute my doctoral thesis was awarded by Solco W. Tromp Foundation in the European Meteorological Society (EMS) Annual Meeting in 2018 (oral presentation). I did several stays in prestigious research Centres, such as North Carolina State University (US), D. Luiz Institute (University of Lisbon, Portugal), and Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies (CESAM) at the University of Aveiro (Portugal), having received several competitive mobility scholarships. I am currently collaborating with the researchers of these institutions as well as with researchers of the University of Valencia (Spain) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). I am an Editor of the Special Issue “Human Health Implications of Droughts” in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
