I am currently a PhD candidate of the Climate Change and Health Research group - EpiClimLab at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) and the Oeschger Center for Climate change Research (OCCR) at the University of Bern (Switzerland). My PhD project focuses on the impact of ambient temperature and other environmental factors on mental health in Switzerland. In particular, I will assess how weather affects the risk of hospital admissions due to mental disorders, mood patterns and cognitive function in older population. 
I was trained as a medical doctor at the Medical University of Tirana. In 2015, I was awarded an ERAWEB scholarship which allowed me to complete a Master in Health Sciences at the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Austria. At UMIT I worked for four years as a researcher. My research work there was mainly focused on cancer screening, Health Technology Assessment and modeling.
