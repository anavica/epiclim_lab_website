I am currently a PhD candidate of the Climate Change and Health Research group - EpiClimLab at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) and the Oeschger Center for Climate change Research (OCCR) at the University of Bern (Switzerland). My focus of research within the group is on Climate Change Adaptation and Future Health Impacts where we mainly explore the impacts of non-optimal temperature on mortality across space and time in Switzerland. The goal of this PhD is to develop a methodological framework to identify the main drivers of adaptation to climate change, and to provide high-resolution projections on climate change impacts in terms of temperature-mortality under composite scenarios of mitigation and adaptation.
I hold an MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Before that, I graduated from Leiden University College The Hague with a degree in liberal arts and Sciences: Global challenges, majoring in Global Public Health. During my studies, besides having touched upon courses varying from health to sustainability, I have done internships on topics varying from microplastics and Geographic Information Systems to internships in Kenya on HIV and VCT clinics.
Recent research stays outside of our own group have been with Yale University under supervision of Dr. Kai Chen, and for the final part of my PhD I will join a climate science group at the University of Bristol led by Dr. Dann Mitchell from January 2023 onwards. The aim is to conclude the PhD by June 2023.
