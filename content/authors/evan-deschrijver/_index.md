I am currently a PhD candidate at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM) and the Oeschger Center for Climate change Research (OCCR) at the University of Bern (Switzerland). My work mainly focuses on climate change, particularly non-optimal temperature, and associated health impacts. The aims of my PhD project are: (1) to develop a methodological framework to identify the main drivers of adaptation to climate change, (2) to provide high-resolution projections on climate change impacts in terms of temperature-mortality under composite scenarios of mitigation and adaptation, (3) to quantify the relative contribution of climate change to the overall observed heat- related mortality.
 
I hold a MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (London, UK) and preceding the MSc, I pursued a BSc in liberal arts and sciences: Global challenges majoring in Global Public Health at Leiden University College The Hague (The Netherlands).
