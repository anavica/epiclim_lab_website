I study climate sciences at the University of Bern Graduate School of Climate Sciences run by the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (Switzerland). This MSc program gives an holistic view over this complex topic and scientific knowledge how to mitigate and adapt to climate change. During my studies I developed a specific interest in climate change and health related research. I am writing my MSc Thesis entitled "Heatwaves and preterm birth in Switzerland" at the EpiClimLab supervised by Dr. Ana Maria Vicedo Cabrera and Coral Salvador (University of Vigo, Spain). In my MSc thesis I study the association between heatwaves and preterm birth in Switzerland between the years 2008-2016.
