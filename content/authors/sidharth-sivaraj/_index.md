I recently joined in February 2022 the Climate Change and Health Research group - EpiClimLab (Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine) as PhD Candidate. I am also a member of the Oeschger Center for Climate change Research (University of Bern). I am interested in studying the health impacts of compound events, i.e., combination of multiple climate drivers and/or hazards contributing to risk. My PhD project will focus on the evaluation of the current and the future compounding health impacts of heat stress and humidity in Switzerland and overseas.
Prior to joining the group as a PhD student, I completed my MSc degree in Climate Sciences from the University of Bern, Switzerland, and an integrated BS-MS degree with specialization in mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune, India. I graduated from my MSc degree with a thesis entitled "Constraining the occurrence probability of compound hot and dry summers in CMIP5 models by using an observational constraint on the dependence between temperature and precipitation". In the coming years, I will be working on my Ph.D. thesis entitled "Assessment of the compounding effect of humidity and heat on human health from an epidemiological perspective" supervised by Dr. Ana Maria Vicedo Cabrera, Prof. Dr. Olivia Romppainen-Martius and Prof. Dr. Stefan Br√∂nnimann.
Growing up near one of the biodiversity hotspots (Western Ghats of India), I have witnessed how climate change and habitat fragmentation have increasingly led to severe adverse impacts, both environmental and societal, over the years. The realization that climate change is the single most defining challenge of our generation is what motivated me to pursue a research career in the field of climate change and health.
