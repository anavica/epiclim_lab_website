EpiClim-Lab works to advance evidence on the impact of climate change and other global change processes on human health. We are interested in translating epidemiological findings into the development of public health strategies to increase resilience of populations to climate hazards and other environmental threats derived from the global change. We are an interdisciplinary team with backgrounds ranging from epidemiology, public health, medicine, environmental sciences and mathematical modelling.

Our research group is located at the Institute of Social and Preventive medicine of the [University of Bern](https://www.ispm.unibe.ch/). The team is member of the [Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/) of the University of Bern. It was created in September 2019 as a joint initiative between the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Sciences of this University.
